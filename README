        Redis-GLib - A Redis Driver for GObject Based Applications
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library piggy backs on top of the hiredis high-performance client
library for Redis. It provides integration with the main loop, as well
as the ability to work with higher level structures as compared to the
strings used by redis.
